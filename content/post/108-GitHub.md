One of the tools we've recommended over and over on our weekly Office Hours Hangouts is GitHub - a version control system built on top of Git. We've recommended customers use GitHub, but never really taken a deep dive into GitHub, and how our customers can start using GitHub. We spent our most recent Hangout to do just that. Check out the highlights below. The entire episode is full of great information and questions from our live audience, and is embedded below. Office Hours Hangouts happen live each week at 1pm Central on our YouTube channel, and the [entire 100+ episode catalog](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXK8KWNgW1Ms1ROsbIhOg6kJV2eOqAP3Y) can be found at YouTube, as well.

## How does GitHub Work?

We invited Martin Smith, one of our DevOps engineers, to join us for the hangout. Martin took a minute to describe [how GitHub works](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAObtTxBUzk&t=10m37s), and some common ways that developers and others might use GitHub. We discussed everything from setting up the repository, to forking and editing and merging code back into the original repository.

## What are some interesting uses for GitHub?

[GitHub isn't just a tool for developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAObtTxBUzk&feature=youtu.be&t=8m32s). Many users find it's a perfect tool for use cases outside of just collaborating on code. For example, we have shared our [Rackspace social media guidelines](https://github.com/rackspace/social_media_guidelines) on GitHub, so that other companies can fork and modify them to work in their own company culture. We also use GitHub to share [job openings](https://github.com/rackspace/rackspace_jobs) - meeting the next batch of Rackers where they already are.

## How can GitHub help with automating code deployments?

We spent a lot of time talking about [using GitHub to automate code deployment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAObtTxBUzk&t=35m40s). Martin's role on one of our DevOps teams means he spends a lot time working with our customers to do just this. He has some great insight into how GitHub is useful to deploy code, especially how we provide a [better approach to DevOps](http://www.rackspace.com/devops).
