summary: "We are thankful for our Rackers who are veterans. Much of what shapes us as Rackspace, and them as Rackers can be attributed to their military service. On this week's Office Hours Hangout we are hosting a roundtable conversation with members of RackerVET, our Employee Resource Group for military veterans at Rackspace. We'll chat about military service, the transition to civilian life, and how these veterans are now employing their skills here at Rackspace."
