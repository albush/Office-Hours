What a great way to start 2017. Rackspace CTO John Engates joined us in the studio to cover his [2017 Cloud Predictions](http://blog.rackspace.com/cloud-predictions-2017) in greater detail. John's a frequent guest, and a long-time Racker. His unique view of the industry always yields great insights, and this week was no exception.

We took the opportunity to look at each of his predictions in greater detail. I was very interested in the way that all of the predictions work together and build on each other. These predictions aren't just guesses, they're observations based on a understanding of the tech ecosystem at a very high level.
