We're focusing our Office Hours Hangouts on Black Friday and Cyber Monday as we approach the big online shopping holiday weekend. We have covered new and improved Rackspace Tools for a successful Black Friday, monitoring infrastructure with Rackspace Intelligence, real-time application analytics with New Relic Insights; so this week we brought it all together with a discussion of the different "levers" our customers can use to fine-tune their site for Black Friday and Cyber Monday success.
