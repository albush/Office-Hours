On [last week's Office Hours Hangout](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/black-friday-is-coming/), cohost Drew Cox and I discussed several new tools, features, and products Rackspace has released in the last year that we think will be most helpful to customers going into the 2015 Black Friday season. One that we are both very excited about is [Rackspace Intelligence](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/rackspace-intelligence-new-features/), our new single pane of glass which gives customers a real-time and comprehensive overview of the health of their infrastructure at one glance. This week we took a deep dive into Intelligence with Intelligence's software engineering manager, David Dunlop. I've highlighted a few key moments, and the entire video is available below.

We started with a [discussion of what Rackspace Monitoring can monitor](https://youtu.be/Sld-_RWDrVQ?t=8m21s), including server performance, availability, and any errors reported from the site. Monitoring can also [trigger alarms](https://youtu.be/Sld-_RWDrVQ?t=13m32s) to designated recipients if the system detects anything outside of preconfigured ranges. David set out some examples of how customers might want to [establish thresholds to trigger alarms](https://youtu.be/Sld-_RWDrVQ?t=17m00s).

Next, we took a [brief tour of Intelligence](https://youtu.be/Sld-_RWDrVQ?t=23m19s) to see some areas where new users can get the most out of Intelligence. The demo covered only a few of the features, but this information can be very helpful to get new users up and running when they first start to use Intelligence.

Finally, we wrapped up with a discussion of the [other Rackspace products and services that integrate well with Intelligence](https://youtu.be/Sld-_RWDrVQ?t=37m49s). Cloud Databases report to Intelligence with no additional configuration required. David also suggests monitoring not just the individual servers, but the load balancers that connect those servers.
