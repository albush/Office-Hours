title: "Fleet Management: Growing our footprint so you can grow yours"
summary: "Fleet Management keeps the fluidity of the cloud under control. It's the work behind the scenes that allows for the on-demand availability of secure and reliable resources. At Rackspace, our public cloud has grown in size, features and underpinnings over the years and this week we are going to interview two of the people that work to facilitate that progress to uncover the value they bring our Public Cloud customers as well as their lessons learned that can be applied to those undertaking their own fleet management challenges."
