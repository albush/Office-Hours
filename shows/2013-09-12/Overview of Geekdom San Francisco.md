This past week we got to take a sneak peak into the newest home for [Geekdom](http://geekdom.com/), the place where startups are born, out in San Francisco. Started almost [two years ago in San Antonio](http://geekdom.com/san-antonio), the hometown of Rackspace, Geekdom became the largest co-working space in Texas with 45,000 square feet of makers, inventors and entrepreneurs. The [San Francisco location](http://geekdom.com/san-francisco) opened up a couple of months ago, so we wanted to chat with some of the folks who worked over there on the West coast.

Bob Hrdinsky, who is leading the new Geekdom office, [gave us an overview of what the collaborative workspace is all about](http://youtu.be/zVLPNyI9Z3A?t=6m). Geekdom SF is located on the first floor of the building that houses our Rackspace office. This gives amazing access to the Rackspace engineers as well as our startup liaison, Robert Scoble. Already the office has seen a workshop on [Docker](https://www.docker.io/), a [One Month Rails](http://onemonthrails.com/) meetup and a panel of customers talking about their experiences.

Josh Miramant from [Good.co](file:///tmp/d20150807-3-h8jmy4/good.co), a [TechStars Cloud company](http://www.techstars.com/cloud/) that worked out of the San Antonio location while participating in the accelerator, was also on hand to talk about his experience with the Geekdom ecosystem. Good.co is a startup that looks at eliminating bad company fit, hoping to increase workplace retention and employee satisfaction. Josh said that it is [challenging for startups and young companies to have exposure to other ideas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVLPNyI9Z3A&feature=youtu.be&t=10m34s), mindsets and technologies. Geekdom and collaborative workspaces not only bring together smart people, but also ideas that can help startups flourish.

If you live either in the Bay Area or San Antonio, I would encourage you to check out the entire Google+ Hangout to find out what Geekdom is all about. Don't forget to also go to the Geekdom website for more information and answers to some common questions. Finally, be sure to tune in this Thursday at 1:00 p.m. CST where we will discuss best practices for the Magento eCommerce platform. You can join the Hangout by going to our [Rackspace Google+ page](http://bit.ly/17Hvgr8). See you then!
