**Office Hours Hangout: Learning about WordPress with CloudU**

If you've ever wanted to host your own #WordPress blog, or learn more about the world's most popular CMS, you're in good company. By most counts, WordPress sites make up almost a quarter of all websites. Amongst CMS based sites, WordPress accounts for about 60% of the sites. Last week Rackspace was happy to announce a brand new CloudU WordPress learning series. This free course combines written and video instruction, with a 30-day free trial of Rackspace Cloud Sites, to give a hands on practical look at hosting your own WordPress sites.

We also hosted a live hangout to discuss this new course, and WordPress in general, with Rackspace WordPress experts. I invited Rackers Anthony Burchell, Drew Cox, Garrett Heath, and Steven Villarreal to chat about WordPress as a platform and as a community joined me. You can catch the whole hangout below, and I've also included a few highlights from our talk.

**WordPress is the "Face" of the Cloud**

CloudU Learning Strategist Steven Villarreal shared that one of the goals that the CloudU team set was to get more people involved in the cloud, with practical education. They chose to use WordPress, because it's a very common CMS, and can be deployed with a single click from both our Cloud Files, and Cloud Servers products.

**Contributing to WordPress**

[We had a lively conversation about contributing to WordPress](http://youtu.be/9QwlNZnelno?t=23m44s). You don't need to be able to write a line of code to contribute – you just need to want to help.  We covered several methods of contributing – from writing core code, to contributing plugins, to just spreading the word about WordPress. There are plenty of ways that any WordPress enthusiast can contribute.

The Flexibility of WordPress

[Drew shared his thoughts on the flexibility of WordPress](http://youtu.be/9QwlNZnelno?t=37m59s), including the possibility of hosting on a number of different platforms – and easily moving between them. Our panel believed it was that flexibility that has helped to move WordPress to the top spot amongst CMSes.

There are a lot more points to go over in the entire video below. Please watch, and leave feedback or questions – we're happy to hear them.
