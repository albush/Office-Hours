New and Improved Rackspace Tools to Prepare Your Site for Holiday Shopping Traffic

Last year on our Office Hours Hangout Drew Cox and I spent a few weeks discussing some strategies and tools for scaling ecommerce sites in anticipation of traffic during the holiday season. If you are responsible for your site's holiday season success, I recommend taking some time to review the videos in this series - they are full of good advice and tools to get ready for a holiday traffic spike.

All of the suggestions in the video series are still applicable, but Rackspace has added several tools and services that can help as you prepare for this year's holiday traffic rush. In our Hangout this week, we'll review some of the new features we've rolled out in the last year, and how you can implement them to improve your site's performance during high traffic periods. We'll be live on Thursday, September 25th at 1:00 p.m. Central Time.

## Performance Cloud Servers

The biggest single new innovation came in the form of our Performance Cloud Servers, launched last November. They're very accurately named with all SSD drives, improved networking and a lower price tag to boot. These servers are a great addition to any stack—especially those applications that are popular during the holiday season.

## On Metal

If you need even more performance, our OnMetal servers fit the bill. These are actual physical, bare metal servers that are deployed via Rackspace's Managed Cloud API. OnMetal servers bring significant performance with the added advantage of fast, easy deployment and per-minute billing.

## Cloud Queues

Cloud Queues can improve your application's performance by decoupling the application. On our last show, we recommended a decoupled application and even mentioned integrating with third party services to build these queues. With the launch of Cloud Queues, Rackspace has this capability ready and waiting for you in your control panel and at a price you'll love—the first one million messages are free.

## Percona and MariaDB in Cloud Databases

Our Cloud Databases Product keeps getting better. There've been steady improvements in the last year and we've now added two new databases to the mix: you can now choose from Percona and MariaDB in addition to the standard MySQL when creating a new Cloud Database. This is great news for our customers who want the ease, redundancy and scalability of Cloud Databases, with the benefits of running Percona or MariaDB.

Percona works very well with Magento - this could be a good match for many of our customers.s. MariaDB is a nice alternative to MySQL, offering additional storage engines and speed improvments.

## Auto Scale

Auto Scale is another great tool that launched last year. This service allows you to set up specific thresholds that can deploy additional servers as traffic increases. Automatically provisioned hardware can be a lifesaver during a high traffic event that sees even more traffic than expected. This is a must-have before your next high traffic event.

These are just a few of the many new and improved tools that Rackspace has built out over the last year. Alone, any of these tools can help improve your site for holiday shopping traffic. Yet when implemented together, they can provide better performance and easier administration at a lower total cost.
