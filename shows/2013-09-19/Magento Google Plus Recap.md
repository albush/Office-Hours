I know that it may be hard to believe, but the shopping season is fast upon us. If you have an Ecommerce site, or have aspirations to set up an Ecommerce solution, you need to start preparing now. This past week we talked about using [Magento](http://www.rackspace.com/ecommerce-hosting/magento/), an open source Ecommerce application that can help you with your online sales. I've [embedded the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7TmgXr4mwk) of the entire Hangout at the bottom of the post, and you can check out the highlights below (however, you will have to pardon our "pirate patches" – we did it in the spirit of Talk Like a Pirate Day).

* Racker Eric Cavalcanti was a former customer who has used Magento since its inception when his wife wanted to run an Ecommerce store.  Eric gives a [little information about his background](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7TmgXr4mwk&feature=share&t=19m40s), how he started one of the first blog's on Magento and became a Magento consultant.

* With the holiday season coming up, Eric [gives some pointers that a Magento user should get in place now](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7TmgXr4mwk&feature=share&t=23m45s) in order to scale for seasonal demand. He suggests putting a load balancer in place, lowering your DNS TTLS, separating your web and database nodes, implementing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and using technology to cache your content for snappier page load times.

* Racker Brint O'Hearn suggests [upgrading your database from MySQL 5.1 to MySQL 5.5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7TmgXr4mwk&feature=share&t=35m26s) to help increase the performance of your Ecommerce site as well.

* If you are currently using plugins on your Magento site, you will definitely want to check out this section of the video where [Eric talks about the best practices for using Magento plugins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7TmgXr4mwk&feature=share&t=36m19s). While not a huge fan of them, he does name some that you will want to have to help with cache your site.

* Eric and I had a chance to talk about [the advantages of the hybrid cloud](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7TmgXr4mwk&feature=share&t=46m27s), in particular the security of a physical firewall, increasing the database performance as well as having PCI compliant site. I go on to talk about how the [cloud is not an "all or nothing" proposition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7TmgXr4mwk&feature=share&t=52m31s)Ã¢ÂÂyou don't have to move your **entire** configuration to the cloud. Instead, you can move the pieces and workloads that make sense over to the cloud and keep the remainder of your stack on physical servers.

That's the recap from our previous show, if you are an Ecommerce customer or are looking to set up a Magento site, I would highly recommend watching the entire video below. We are going to be back this Thursday at 1:00 p.m. CST where we will be sharing tips and tricks to prepare your site for increased holiday shopping traffic.
