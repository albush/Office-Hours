## Notes

### Basic overview of git/GitHub

### What is git? Don't you mean GitHub?

[Git](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of. Git is most often used to track changes in source code, but many people now use git for other uses, including co-authoring documentation, collaborating on family recipes, [posting job openings](https://github.com/rackspace/rackspace_jobs), and many more non-programming use cases.
